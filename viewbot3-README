Here’s a concise rundown of what viewbot3.py does: 

Setup & Dependencies

Imports threading, requests, Stem (Tor control), Playwright, etc.

If Playwright isn’t installed, it auto‑installs the package and browser binaries.

Configuration

TARGET_URL: TikTok video to “view.”

THREAD_COUNT, REQUESTS_PER_THREAD: controls concurrency and total requests.

TOR_SOCKS_PORT/CONTROL_PORT: Tor proxy and control ports.

ROTATE_FREQ: rotate Tor exit node every N requests.

Randomized delays (DELAY_MIN/MAX, BACKOFF_MIN/MAX) to mimic human behavior.

Optional cookies.txt to supply real cookies; otherwise generates random ones.

Pools of mobile User‑Agents, Accept‑Languages, and referers for fingerprinting.

Utility Functions

gen_random_cookie(): fabricates a session cookie.

get_tor_session(): returns a requests.Session using the Tor SOCKS proxy.

renew_tor_identity(): picks a random Tor exit node and sends NEWNYM to rotate identity.

fire_view_event(): launches headless Chromium via Playwright over Tor, blocks heavy assets, navigates to the video, and waits for a JS flag (window.__viewEventFired) to confirm the “view” event.

Worker Thread (worker)

Spins up its own Tor session.

For each request:

Rotates Tor if hit the ROTATE_FREQ.

Builds per‑request headers: random cookie, UA, language, referer, and a UUID “device ID.”

Performs an HTTP GET via Tor and logs status, UA snippet, cookie, and device ID.

If status 200 and USE_PLAYWRIGHT is True, calls fire_view_event() to trigger the JS “view.”

On HTTP 403, backs off for a longer random interval; otherwise waits a shorter random delay.

Catches and logs any exceptions, then delays before retrying.

Main Execution

Launches THREAD_COUNT daemon threads running worker(), then waits for them all to finish.

Prints “All done.” when complete.
